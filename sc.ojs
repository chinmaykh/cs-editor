md`# Maxwell Distribution`

md` In this exercise, we develop the Maxwell's distribution for molecular velocities. It is a classical concept and explains the molecular velocity distributio very accurately in the correct range.`

md` Mathematically, we want to find the <i> probability distribution function </i> for the velocity random variable. <br><br> This means, we need to find the function 'f' of the form`
