Phase diagrams

1. Solid solubility. Didn't know it could be processed like that  became clear when liquid phases got involved.
2. Phases
3. Phase boundary study
4. Use of thermodynamics - Gibbs free energy to explain phase equilibrium
5. Simplicity and effectiveness of the phase diagram
6. Revealing fact was about understanding the difference between phase composition and phase amounts.
7. Cooling - non equilibrium cooling and diffusion as a time independent phenomenon - Googling about the iron triple point and finding out about
8. Binary eutectic systems and formation of micro structures. 

The topic starts with the concept of a solid solutions. I had not thought of solids being dissolved in another solid, but by drawing parallels to sugar dissolved in water, I was able to construct a mental image. 

Then we learnt about phases. Phases are a homogenous part of the system which have consistent physical and chemical properties. The concept of a phase is fundamental and noting the time independent definition is required as a phase is not defined by how long it exists for. This is a nice segway to what was next - thermodynamics and equilibrium. It is imperative to understand that thermodynamics of a system because it will illustrate which direction a transformation can happen or how long the system can stay the way it is - the stability of the system. The Gibbs free energy is a concept i have studied before in thermodynamics and it's application to such a system was nice. usually, we see it in the context of a gas/liquid doing work and applying it to a solid system was intriguing. 

This was followed by phase diagrams. A phase diagram is simply a plot between the phase of a system and how it is influenced by primarily 3 parameters - 
1. Temperature
2. Concentration
3. Pressure

I shall speak mainly about the concentration and temp plot as it the most discussed one in class and important for alloying phase transformations. The temp vs pressure plot is the quite basic one which we are used to dealing with especially in the case of water. (more on this later). 

A concept which I had got mixed up initially but after a few readings got cleared up was the difference between phase amounts and phase concentrations. Of course, now it seems trivial but at the time I had mixed up the understanding. Phase conc and phase amount

Microstructure formation. The most interesting topic.  The formation of appropriate microstructure is the ultimate aim of the alloying process. All basic mechanical properties can be attributed to the characteristics of the microstructure. Here, I shall explain the two topics which I loved studying about. 

Firstly, the formation. The creation happens by a delicate interplay of nucleation and growth. As usual application of thermodynamic shows that there are two factors involved - volume and surface energies. This is characterized by the usual inverse-square-inverse-cube relationship which necessitates that a certain threshold energy must be reached before the nucleation process becomes stable. A more in-depth mathematical formulation shows nucleation decreases with increase in temperature. 

The second process which is important is growth. Growth depends on the amount of molecules hitting the surface of the growing phase region and thus in a passive system, diffusion is responsible for the necessary transport. Thus, there is an exponential relation to temperature and growth.

The final rate of formation is a product of the two process and this forms an interesting case. We need more temperature for growth but less temperature for nucleation, so we have to achieve a sweet-spot temperature when a maxima is achieved. This is reflected as the maxima in the TTT curve and this beautiful molecular interplay excites me to study more such properties. I listed a bunch of points to think about and deepen my understanding. Some of these were - 
1. Active transport for material transport - what is there was an active process enabling the transport.
2. Nucleation initiation - what processes increase nucleation ? An exciting result of the line of thought led me t the discovery of instant cooling ice - So distilled water when kept undisturbed at sub 0 temperatures occasionally will not form ice because there are not places in the water were a ice-nucleus starts developing. A strong concentrated force can temporarily produce a minute nucleus and thus the whole ice freezes on instant. A famous science presenter - derek muller from veri ta siu m makes a video on the same.

The term paper was surely fun to write. My topic was strong materials. I presented my paper as a competition between materials. I hope it was a fun read. The highlight of that paper was a materials which I found called AMLS - additively manufactured lattice structures ! These phenomenal structures are a recent development. THe AMLS consists of the metal which is 3d printed into geometrical shapes which resemble unit cells. The beauty is in the detail. These structures are extremely light because the structure is only composed of rods joining nodes, but they are almost comparable to the initial metal in terms of mechanical properties. This is because the forces are redirected through the node network and distributes the strain in simple yet creative manners. The overall effect is that no one part of the material is strained excessively and the highly parallel nature means that failure at certain nodes will not affect overall strength of the material. This is important as in usual metals, manufacturing defects can have a cascading problem of crack propagation and finally failure, but AMLS allows tolerance for such details. Another interesting material which I found while doing this research was that of a special alloy which I shall be elaborating in my second term paper known as TZM - titanium zirconium molybdenum. This is an extremely strong alloy whose use is ( aha not so fast, I shall reveal that in my second term paper ). But the strength comes from the addition of zirconium an carbon to the alloy. Much like carbon-steel hardening, the carbon occupies voids and cracks and improves life but the addition of zirconium and titanium elements which are vertical neighbors in the periodic table produces exponential strengthening. 

In a nutshell, the fascinating part of materials science and engineering is 2 parts - 
1. The pronounced effect of atomic and molecular interplay
2. The amalgamation of multiple disciplines concepts and phenomenon.

After India conducted the Pokhran Nuclear tests, america stopped many exports as a mark of protest. of the goods not exported were several crucial materials important for manufacturing, healthcare, construction, spaceflight etc. This was a very important period of realization that materials are invaluable to a nations growth. I would definitely like to participate in the fabrication and study of many more interesting materials. 

Thank you.
