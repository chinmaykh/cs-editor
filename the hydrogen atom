                            We now arrive at the most basic atom - hydrogen. A straightforward system and the door to
                            more complex atoms. We consider this system because

                            Let's start with what we already know from previous models. We shall take the basics and
                            introduce quantum mechanical calculations when needed.

                            To determine the mechanics of the electron in the orbit, we need to solve the Schrodinger
                            Wave Equation. Since the potential is time independent, we shall use the time independent
                            schrodinger equation for all calculations.

                            This is kinda good, but since we are dealing with a 3D system, why not use a better coordinate system for ease. From here one, we can use the spherical polar system. In this system, the potential becomes.

                            We can start. Boundary Conditions can be introduced when needed than dumping them here. We
                            start at home - the Schrodinger Wave Equation. A established, the potential is time
                            independent, so we need to solve the time-independent version.

                            For conversion, first, we need to make the spatial differential in 3D. This means the second
                            order spatial differential becomes a laplacian. Then a change of basis will make the laplacian
                            operate on \( (r,\theta, \phi) \). The
                            spherical
                            polar laplacian is a nightmarish landscape. But, as we'll see it's pretty timid once
                            you get
                            familiar. I would suggest writing it down a few times.

                            The approach to solving this is the same as the 1 dimensional potential well. The variables need to be separated. As there are 3 basis variables, I shall write the wave function as a product of the three functions. After some transposition, we observe.
